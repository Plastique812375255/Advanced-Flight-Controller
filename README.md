## Advanced-Flight-Controller
A new kind of RC remote controller which includes intelligent receiver that can optionally add functions.  
Use Android as the UI user machine to control the upper **microcontroller** for operation.  
Most calculations are based on the RX, with the TX transmitting only the sticks and switchs positions as much as possible.  
Inspiration source: **Vbar Control**. *Thank you, Mikado*.  
**Warning: Cause I'm Chinese, although I have worked in English for many years, but my partner cannot use English as Americans. So there will be a large number of Mandarin. Get used to that. I will add the translation.  **

使用安卓作为UI用户机，控制上层的**单片机**进行工作。  
大部分计算基于接收端，发射端尽可能只传递摇杆与开关位置。  
灵感来源：**Vbar Control**。*谢谢你，Mikado*。
